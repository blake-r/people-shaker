## Welcome to People Shaker project home page

Nowadays of virtual communications it's so easy to fall out of the stream of life and to narrow down an environment to close friends and coworkers only.

That's why the project was born. Its goal is to give people the opportunity to expand their social life and get new interesting acquaintances. Do you know, how different people can be, how much interesting new communications can bring to our lives?! :dizzy:

### How it works

Every week our bot finds a match based on your location and interests. After receiving a contact, you negotiate suitable time and place to meet. ü§ù

One acquaintances per week may not sound significant, but let's rephrase: it is 52 new acquaintances in a year! üåü 

### How to start

At the moment the only supported interface is a Telegram bot. We plan to enlarge supporting systems later, and maybe to create an own web application.

To start getting new mates every week, just add the [@peopleshaker_bot](https://t.me/peopleshaker_bot) Telegram bot and answer its questions about you and your preferences. The first matching will happen when the project accumulates enough people (10 in a single location or 100 in total).

### Support or Contact

### Project needs

This project is free, so your participation is highly welcomed in those topics:

1. Art. It would be nice for the project to have a personal unique logo. The currently using images are taken from open sources.
2. Presentation and propagation. Writing attractive articles about the project and opportunities it discovers which can describe its value.
3. Localization. It would be great if you could improve current translations or write a new one. At the moment the bot is translated to next languages:
   * English
   * Russian
